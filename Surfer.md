An initial `nmap` scan showed two ports open and a disallowed webpage on the robots.txt file. <br>

Visiting the disallowed page a chat dialogue is shown. <br>
And it sounds like `admin:admin` are the credentials. <br>

I ran a `Gobuster` scan to see if there were any other directories of interest. <br>

I also ran a `Nikto` scan to be sure there wasnâ€™t any other low hanging fruit. <br>

At the main web page, the credentials from earlier did work and I was able to log in as admin. <br>
On the right side of the page there was a file that was located at <i>/internal/admin.php</i> <br>

When trying to access the file, the message displayed is that it can only be accessed locally. <br>
Okay, there has to be a way to open that file.. At the bottom of the main page there is an `export to pdf` button. <br>
The report that is generated from the <i>export to pdf</i> looks like it could potentially be vulnerable to SSRF (server side request forgery). <br>
Upon intercepting the same report request with `Burpsuite` I tried to have it display the page as the report. <br>

By changing the <i>server-info.php</i> to <i>internal/admin.php</i> and forwarding that request the server produces the file and the flag is displayed. <br>
